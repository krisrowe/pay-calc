## Files

### `2024 Tax Projection Export.csv`

This is a **real export from Employer A Sheets** of a tax projection that was created using formulas. This projection was **quite successful in accurately predicting** the tax situation for the 2024 tax year. It serves as a reference for the methodology and structure used in tax projections.

### `2025_tax_projection.csv`

This file was **generated by the LLM agent** while working on this repository **before we had scripts** to generate tax projections programmatically. It has **not at all been validated for accuracy**, but is being kept around for now to compare the output of our new script (`generate_tax_projection.py`) that we will build to generate the same programmatically instead of non-deterministically.

The goal is to eventually replace this manually-generated file with programmatically-generated versions that can be validated and reproduced.

### `2025_ye_estimation.md`

This markdown file explains the calculations used to generate the `2025_tax_projection.csv` file. It provides a detailed breakdown of:

- HIM (his) income and tax summary
- Employer A LLC detailed breakdown by pay period
- HER (her) detailed breakdown
- Combined taxable income calculations
- Social Security overpayment calculations
- Federal tax refund/owed projections

This document was created to document the manual calculation process before the automated scripts were developed. It serves as a reference for understanding the tax projection methodology.

# Validation Configuration
# Controls how pay stub validation handles discrepancies between
# displayed "current" values and actual YTD increases.
#
# Some fields have known UI bugs where the PDF displays incorrect
# current values, but YTD is correct. These are configured as warnings.
# All other fields with current != YTD increase result in errors.
validation:
  # Fields where current != YTD increase should be a warning, not an error.
  # Each entry specifies the field name (from earnings) and a description.

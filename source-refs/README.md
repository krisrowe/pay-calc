# Source References

This directory contains source documents that are for reference purposes only and are not intended to be programmatically parsed.

This includes:
- Image-based PDFs that cannot be read by text extraction libraries.
- Manually created documents that serve as documentation.
- Other reference materials.

Data from these documents must be manually transcribed into the appropriate JSON format in the `data` directory. When doing so, the `metadata.type` in the JSON file should be set to `"manual"`.
